---Feathers McGraw's Cheese Heist--

Challenge: Feathers McGraw is planning a heist, and the target is Wallace's stash of cheese. Each piece of cheese has a value. Feathers is only interested in high-value cheeses, so he needs a function to filter out the lower-value cheeses and calculate the total value of the high-value cheeses.+

---Cheese Values---

Cheddar - Value: 10
Brie - Value: 12
Gouda - Value: 15
GruyÃ¨re - Value: 18
Camembert - Value: 20
Roquefort - Value: 25
Mozzarella - Value: 8
Parmesan - Value: 22
Feta - Value: 7
Blue Cheese - Value: 30
Swiss - Value: 14
Ricotta - Value: 6
Manchego - Value: 19
Edam - Value: 9
Monterey Jack - Value: 13

--Outcomes--
Input: An array of integers representing cheese values and a threshold value to determine which cheeses Feathers will steal.
Output: The total value of the cheeses that are worth more than or equal to the threshold.
